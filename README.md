### > How Did I Complete This Project

For this project i was tasked to build an interactive rating component which allows a user to select a score from 1-5 and the user can submit that score. If the user doesn't select a score 0 is, then submitted. Once the user has submitted their score a different component will appear with their score and a message. I created the layout with HTML and CSS whilst using Figma as a reference for the intended mobile and desktop designs. I used JavaScript to create the functionality of the changing the components when i user submits a score. I used the following technologies in this project:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Figma
